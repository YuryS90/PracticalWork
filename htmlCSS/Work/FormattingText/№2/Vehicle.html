        <h1>Vehicle</h1>
        <p> A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<span class="ss">[1]</span>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,
            boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<span class="ss">[2]</span></p>
        <p> Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms
            and definitions.<span class="ss">[3]</span></p>
