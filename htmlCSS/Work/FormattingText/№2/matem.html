    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">ax + b = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="red">a</span> and <span class="red">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="red">x</span>
        is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an <span class="red">x</span> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="red">x</span> there.
    </p>
    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="red">a</span>, <span class="red">b</span>, <span class="red">c</span> are known values and
        <span class="red">x</span>
        is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="red">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p><span class="red">π</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="red">r</span>) squared:</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">A = π × r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="red">D</span>):</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">A = (π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="red">C</span>):</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π</span></p>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="red">A</span> and <span class="red">B</span>, denoted by A ⋂ B, is
        the set of all objects that are members of both
        the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <p class="formul"><span class="back">A ⋂ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</span></p>
    <p>That is, <span class="red">x</span> is an element of the intersection A ⋂ B if and only if <span class="red">x</span> is both an element of <span class="red">A</span> and an element
        of <span class="red">B</span>.</p>
