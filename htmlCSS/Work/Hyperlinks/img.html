        <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
            programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could
            produce entirely different weaves
            by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
        </p>
        <p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
            algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
            Analytical Engine. Women would
            continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control
            panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by
            the late 1940s, unit record
            equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the
            first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced in 1949,
            both programs and data were
            stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.
        </p>
        <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
            often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction
            in a text format, (e.g., ADD
            X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses.
            However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any
            two machines with different instruction
            sets also have different assembly languages. Kathleen Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in
            1950 for various computers at Birkbeck College.
